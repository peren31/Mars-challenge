# Mars Data Scrape and Analysis 
This project involves scraping data from Mars-related websites to gather news articles and weather data. You will complete two main tasks as outlined below. By the end, youâ€™ll have two deliverables that showcase your ability to gather, analyze, and visualize web data.

Deliverables
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data from a table format.
Files
Download the necessary files from the Module 11 Challenge files to get started.

Instructions
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Open the Notebook: Locate and open part_1_mars_news.ipynb in the starter code folder.

Automate Browsing: Use automated browsing tools to visit the Mars News website.

Scrape Content:

Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.
Identify and scrape the titles and preview text of each article.
Store the Data:

For each news article, store the title and preview text in a Python dictionary with the following structure:
